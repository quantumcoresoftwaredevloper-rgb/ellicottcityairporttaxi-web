# Production entrypoint for the API. PM2 runs this, not `node src/index.js`
# directly.
#
# Why this exists: PM2 spawns the app from its own daemon's environment, and the
# `.env` file beside the app was never reliably loaded from it. The result was a
# crash loop with `TypeError: JwtStrategy requires a secret or key` — passport
# builds its strategy at module load, so it saw `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` as undefined.
# Sourcing `.env` here, in the shell, exports every variable before Node starts,
# which is the only ordering that works. `dotenv` inside the app then has nothing
# left to do.
#
# No secret is ever written in this file. `.env` stays gitignored and lives only
# on the server; `set -a` exports whatever it contains.
